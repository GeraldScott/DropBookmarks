# DropBookmarks

A simple Dropwizard 1.0.x project exposing REST API to store bookmarks. The 
application is using MySql as a DBMS.

Database settings are in the config.yml file. To switch to another RDBMS one 
should modify the driver and connection URL. By default it is necessary to create 
DropBookmarks database and it will be populated using migrations.
